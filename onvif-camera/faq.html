                <h1 class="faq-page">Recommendation for Initial Setup</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>We highly recommend that all users first visit the 'Settings' page in our app to configure key
                        aspects of their
                        streaming experience. This includes setting the video resolution, frames per second (fps), and
                        audio quality to levels
                        that best suit your needs and device capabilities.

                        Resolution: Choose the appropriate resolution based on the balance between video clarity and
                        your device’s processing
                        power, as well as network bandwidth. A standard setting of 1280x720 is often sufficient, but
                        feel free to adjust based
                        on your specific requirements.

                        Frames Per Second (fps): Adjust the fps to find the right balance between smooth video playback
                        and resource usage. The
                        app offers Low (15 fps), Medium (25 fps), and High (30 fps) settings. The Medium setting is
                        recommended for most users.

                        Audio Quality: Select from High, Medium, and Low audio quality settings. These settings adjust
                        the sample rate and
                        bitrate to balance sound clarity with data usage. For general purposes, the Medium setting is
                        often adequate.

                        By carefully adjusting these settings, you can optimize the app’s performance, ensuring a smooth
                        and enjoyable streaming
                        experience while conserving your device’s resources such as battery life, CPU usage, and network
                        bandwidth.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-page">Q: What resolution should I set for optimal performance?</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>A: The appropriate resolution setting in the app depends on a balance among video clarity,
                        network bandwidth, and
                        battery usage. Higher resolutions provide clearer video quality, but they consume more bandwidth
                        and drain battery life
                        more quickly. A resolution of 1280x720 is generally recommended as it offers a good balance for
                        most users. If you wish
                        to enhance clarity, you can try increasing the resolution, but keep an eye on the playback
                        performance in your player.
                        Should you encounter lag, stuttering, or pixelation, it could indicate that the resolution is
                        too high for your
                        network's bandwidth or too demanding on your device's battery. In such cases, reducing the
                        resolution can lead to
                        smoother playback, less bandwidth consumption, and slower battery drain. Finding the right
                        balance between resolution,
                        network usage, and battery life is key to ensuring a satisfying user experience without
                        overtaxing your device’s
                        resources.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-page">Q: What frames per second (fps) setting should I choose?</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>A: FPS, or frames per second, refers to the rate at which consecutive images (frames) appear on a
                        display. Our app
                        provides three preset options for fps: Low, Medium, and High, corresponding to 15, 25, and 30
                        fps, respectively. A
                        higher fps results in smoother video but also leads to greater consumption of network bandwidth,
                        CPU resources, and
                        battery power. We generally recommend selecting the Medium option, which is 25 fps, as it offers
                        a good balance between
                        video fluidity and resource usage. This setting provides smooth video playback while minimizing
                        the strain on your
                        network, device performance, and battery life. However, you can adjust the fps according to your
                        specific needs and the
                        capabilities of your device and network.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-page">Q: How should I set the audio quality in the app?</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>A: The app provides three preset levels for audio quality: High, Medium, and Low. These levels
                        correspond to different
                        combinations of sample rates and bitrates. Specifically, the High setting is at a sample rate of
                        44100 KHz with a
                        bitrate of 128 Kbps. The Medium setting also uses a sample rate of 44100 KHz, but with a lower
                        bitrate of 93 Kbps.
                        Finally, the Low setting offers a sample rate of 16000 Hz with a bitrate of 64 Kbps. For most
                        users, we recommend
                        selecting the Medium quality level. This setting provides a good balance between audio clarity
                        and resource usage, such
                        as network bandwidth. It is suitable for general purposes where clear audio is
                        desired without excessive
                        consumption of data. You can adjust the settings according to your specific
                        needs and the limitations
                        of your device or network.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-page">Q: Why does this app require Camera, Microphone, and Network permissions? Can I
                    grant
                    only some of these permissions?
                    allow Cemera or Microphone</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>A: No, it is not possible to grant only some of these permissions for the app to function
                        properly.
                        This app is designed to
                        capture and transmit audio and video data, which necessitates the use of Camera and Microphone
                        permissions. The Camera
                        permission is essential for accessing the device's camera to capture video. The Microphone
                        permission is required to
                        record audio, an integral part of the video streaming and recording functionalities.
                        Additionally, the Network
                        permission is crucial for the app as it provides ONVIF services, which involve transmitting the
                        captured audio and video
                        data over a network. This service is fundamental for remote access and control of the video
                        stream, making the network
                        connectivity a core component of the app’s functionality. Without all three permissions -
                        Camera, Microphone, and
                        Network - the app cannot perform its intended tasks, such as streaming and capturing audio-video
                        content, and providing
                        ONVIF compliant services to users.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-page">Q:Can this app run in the background?</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>A: Yes, the app is capable of running in the background, and we recommend doing so. Running in
                        the
                        background allows the
                        app to reduce resource usage, particularly in terms of video rendering in the foreground.
                        However, if you encounter any
                        issues with the app while it's running in the background, you have the option to switch it to
                        the foreground. To further
                        decrease resource consumption, you can navigate to the 'Settings' or 'Help' pages within the
                        app. This maneuver
                        significantly lowers resource usage as these pages are less resource-intensive compared to the
                        main streaming or
                        capturing functionalities. Please note that when the app is in the background, avoid using other
                        resource-heavy
                        applications on your Android device. The Android system might close background apps to free up
                        resources. Also, refrain
                        from running apps that require Camera or Microphone access as they might interfere with the
                        functionalities of our app.
                        Ensuring these precautions can help maintain optimal performance of the app, providing
                        uninterrupted ONVIF services
                        whether in the foreground or background.
