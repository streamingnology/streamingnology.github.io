                <h1 class="faq-page">Q: Why does this app require Camera, Microphone, and Network permissions? Can I
                    grant
                    only some of these permissions?
                    allow Cemera or Microphone</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>A: No, it is not possible to grant only some of these permissions for the app to function
                        properly.
                        This app is designed to
                        capture and transmit audio and video data, which necessitates the use of Camera and Microphone
                        permissions. The Camera
                        permission is essential for accessing the device's camera to capture video. The Microphone
                        permission is required to
                        record audio, an integral part of the video streaming and recording functionalities.
                        Additionally, the Network
                        permission is crucial for the app as it provides ONVIF services, which involve transmitting the
                        captured audio and video
                        data over a network. This service is fundamental for remote access and control of the video
                        stream, making the network
                        connectivity a core component of the appâ€™s functionality. Without all three permissions -
                        Camera, Microphone, and
                        Network - the app cannot perform its intended tasks, such as streaming and capturing audio-video
                        content, and providing
                        ONVIF compliant services to users.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-page">Q:Can this app run in the background?</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>A: Yes, the app is capable of running in the background, and we recommend doing so. Running in
                        the
                        background allows the
                        app to reduce resource usage, particularly in terms of video rendering in the foreground.
                        However, if you encounter any
                        issues with the app while it's running in the background, you have the option to switch it to
                        the foreground. To further
                        decrease resource consumption, you can navigate to the 'Settings' or 'Help' pages within the
                        app. This maneuver
                        significantly lowers resource usage as these pages are less resource-intensive compared to the
                        main streaming or
                        capturing functionalities. Please note that when the app is in the background, avoid using other
                        resource-heavy
                        applications on your Android device. The Android system might close background apps to free up
                        resources. Also, refrain
                        from running apps that require Camera or Microphone access as they might interfere with the
                        functionalities of our app.
                        Ensuring these precautions can help maintain optimal performance of the app, providing
                        uninterrupted ONVIF services
                        whether in the foreground or background.
